# AGENTS.md — persistent brain of BNOW.NET

Read this first in every fresh session. Keep it under ~300 lines; details live in `docs/`.

**Maintenance rule — ONLY the decision log is append-only.** Every standing section
(Current state, Architecture, directory map, Standing rulings, credentials, conventions,
protocol) MUST be corrected in place the moment it becomes wrong; append a log entry
recording that the correction happened. Never leave wrong standing text with the fix
buried in a log entry. When the log outgrows this file, move its oldest entries
**verbatim** to `docs/DECISIONS.md` (the append-only archive) — moving preserves
history; editing or summarizing it is forbidden.

## Project charter

BNOW.NET is a subscription OSINT data-intelligence product: per-country conflict-monitoring
feeds (open news + Telegram + X), **transparent source-reliability ratings** derived from
ISW's own citation/hedging behavior, an automated daily digest, and a public validation
scoreboard that scores our digests against ISW's daily Russian Offensive Campaign
Assessments. Paying users: analysts, risk teams, journalists, desks ($400–$4K/mo tiers).
Theaters: **Russia + Ukraine + Iran live**; Israel/Gulf ingesting but shallow; bh/kw
scaffolded; China deferred. Authoritative spec: `docs/PRODUCT-BRIEF.md` (installed 2026-07-06).

## Architecture

Stack: Next.js 16 App Router (TS strict) on Vercel · Neon Postgres + pgvector · Drizzle ORM ·
Tailwind v4 · Auth.js (magic link, `session.strategy='database'`) · Vitest (node; jsdom +
@testing-library per-file for component tests). LLM behind `AnalysisProvider`: `openai` live
(gpt-4o-mini), `anthropic` implemented in the seam (no key in any env yet — auto-selected if
an Anthropic key exists and no OpenAI key does), `stub` deterministic fallback.
**No shadcn/ui and no Radix.** UI deps are clsx + tailwind-merge + lucide-react; interactive
primitives (e.g. `src/components/nav-dropdown.tsx`) are hand-rolled to WAI-ARIA patterns.

## Current state — compact snapshot (verified 2026-07-16; correct in place)

Detailed operational/product state lives in `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` and is corrected in
place whenever reality changes. Historical narrative: `docs/PROGRESS.md` + `docs/reviews/`;
debt: `docs/OPEN-TASKS.md`; decision history: `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

- **Live/repository:** https://bnow.net · Vercel `bnow-net` / team `vociferous`; production
  `dpl_DhMh12dn4fdXCesEhXnpxw546Qkw` from main `35b97bd`; rollback
  `dpl_DzTtLPHVCrqbDZsLKqag5bNmndz8` / `426c627`; origin/main == local main at last
  reconciliation. Deployment URLs are SSO-walled — verify through the project domain.
- **Coverage/data:** Russia, Ukraine, Iran live; Israel/Gulf shallow; bh/kw scaffolded; China
  deferred. Registry: 6,985 ISW-derived sources / 251K citations / 1,565 reports. Live ingest:
  29 RSS, GDELT (flaky), Telegram web + MTProto, twitterapi.io X, procurement (proxy-blocked).
  Stub/fixture sources never persist or render as fact.
- **X/Telegram operations:** X July 9–13 gap recovered cursor-complete; automatic bounded
  long-park catch-up + health alerts deployed. #38/#66 await a natural scheduled unhealthy →
  recovery proof; do not manufacture paid failure. MTProto is live/top-120 ROCA-only; non-fatal
  GramJS peer-type `CastError` noise remains #69.
- **Analysis:** versioned map stage feeds the production `mapreduce` digest engine; K=5 voting,
  majority-gid fill, publication-safety guard, and thin-regeneration guard are binding. Gulf
  theaters fall back to legacy where map claims are absent. Validation uses k=5 LLM matching
  with keyword fallback and exposes coverage/divergence/timeliness/thin-source metrics.
- **Product/access:** invite-only private beta; public access request flow; pricing redirects to
  `/access`. Registry/admin surfaces remain admin-only. Signals are anonymous teaser-only and
  accepted-user detailed, with source-attributed named people + non-endorsement notice. Ask v2,
  free Search, digests/archive/scoreboard, entities, trade/datadark/materials are live behind
  their documented gates.
- **Legal/analytics/email:** Terms 1.1 (2026-07-16) + Privacy 1.2; current clickwrap required.
  Postmark `BNOW.NET <no-reply@bnow.net>` is live; magic-link guidance is single-use/24h and
  copy-before-opening. PostHog is production-only, explicit opt-in, allowlist-sanitized, UUID
  identity, no Ask/Search/source text; GeoIP is retained per disclosed operator ruling.
- **Quality/ops:** 1,542 unit tests / 134 files on main + 32 real-Postgres integration tests /
  7 files, all green (1,562 / 135 on the unmerged `codex/analyst-experience-quick-wins`).
  Enforced pre-push gate = typecheck+lint+test. Crons: fast */15; telegram :10; X :20;
  MTProto :35;
  map :40; digest 4×/day; validate/enrich/datadark daily; trade/materials monthly.
  OpenSanctions fixed-cutoff rescore is deployed, and claim-linked spend eligibility (#17 spend
  subset) is deployed — every /match candidate and the `remaining` count now require ≥1
  `claim_entities` row, so the 186 zero-link missing/stub rows can no longer be billed. Paid
  rescore remains closed pending #61 cleanup/recount and separate spend authorization.

## Standing rulings (distilled from the decision log; binding until a log entry supersedes)

Invariants — absolute, each owned here:

1. **Legal:** no ISW prose or source full-text in any user-facing output — only URLs,
   classifications, counts, scores. ISW takeaway text may enter an LLM prompt
   transiently; only verdicts persist.
2. **Traceability:** every claim keeps ≥1 raw_document link (FK + app-layer transaction
   + DB trigger `drizzle/9999_claim_source_trigger.sql`; `migrations.test.ts` guards it).
3. **Truth-in-UI:** stub/fixture data never persists or renders as fact — excluded at
   query level and HIDDEN entirely, never demo-labelled.
4. **Spend:** every paid-provider call passes `SpendGuard.tryReserve()` first and FAILS
   CLOSED when its total-cap env is unset. Caps: `LLM_SPRINT_USD_CAP` (all-time
   backstop), `LLM_DIGEST_USD_CAP` (daily), `MAP_USD_CAP_DAILY`, `ASK_USD_CAP_DAILY` +
   `EMBED_USD_CAP_DAILY` (daily, ask v2 + embeddings), `X_SPRINT_USD_CAP` +
   `X_DAILY_USD_CAP`, `OPENSANCTIONS_CALL_CAP`. Set a new cap env in ALL Vercel envs
   BEFORE deploying the guard that reads it, or you stop that pipeline.
5. **Migrations:** never edit or delete an applied migration; evolve forward with a new
   one. `9999_claim_source_trigger.sql` re-asserts without DROP, always applies last —
   never renumber it or let drizzle-kit regeneration drop it.

Operational rulings:

6. LLM proposals are never auto-applied — entity audit is propose-only with human review.
7. Batched per-item LLM extraction MUST pin `minItems`/`maxItems` = batch size in the
   strict response schema: gpt-4o-mini silently under-fills otherwise (43–57% omission
   measured; prompt wording does not fix it, constrained decoding does).
8. LLM metering lives inside the provider's `analyze()`, never at call sites; truncated
   responses are recorded before being discarded (OpenAI bills them in full).
9. `LLM_DISABLE=1` semantics differ by call site ON PURPOSE: digest / anthropic /
   entity-audit throw typed `LlmDisabledError`; llm-match degrades to keyword matcher;
   /ask degrades to its deterministic cited-claims path (a throw there would cost a
   validation run or 500 a user page).
10. `cron_runs` rows are written at START; `finished_at IS NULL` is the timeout signal.
11. Language routing: fa→ir and uk→ua, plus per-channel theater pins. Arabic is NEVER
    routed by language — it spans six theaters; per-channel pins carry it. Theater is
    a coverage lens, not nationality: the three Lebanese channels are pinned to ir
    (2026-07-09 adjudication of #29); multi-theater source tagging is the eventual
    fix (OPEN-TASKS #37).
12. Dedup verdicts are same-theater and ±1 day only — cross-theater collapse drops
    claims; identical content on distant days is a recurring template, not a mirror.
13. Map extraction is versioned: `extractor_version` = model + prompt hash; consumers
    filter to `mapExtractorVersion()` current versions or they double-count.
    `raw_documents.processed` means exactly "map reached a final disposition"; version
    bumps need their own remap path (OPEN-TASKS #33).
14. Digest corpora are strictly per-theater (`rd.country_iso2`), reliability-ordered,
    with the ~40% source-mix cap on gather window and LLM batch.
15. Nav promotes only ru/ua/ir in the Coverage dropdown (promoting the shallow 6–9-digest
    theaters overstates depth); coverage links go to the real per-country pages
    `/countries/<iso2>` (public, indexable; the old `#<iso2>` anchors on the /countries
    index are kept so bookmarks still scroll — corrected 2026-07-12 IA refinement, when the
    per-country pages replaced the anchors and Signals+Ask were promoted out of a retired
    Product group); locale links carry no `?to=` (Referer round-trips path+query, `?to=`
    drops query).
16. Unhedged ISW declaratives stay `hedging='unknown'` (mid-trust 0.5) — forcing the 4
    classes would corrupt the reliability signal.
17. Don't trust a lone digest regeneration: extraction yield varies wildly between
    identical runs (10→1 claims observed). The shared persist guard now refuses
    empty and thin (<50% of prior claims) overwrites on BOTH engines
    (`digest-persist.ts`; FORCE_REGEN=1 override; refusals land in cron_runs).
18. The mapreduce engine ships only its A/B-validated configuration: K=5 synthesis
    votes + majority-gid fill (K=3 FAILED the variance gate — marginal events flip
    out of 2-of-3 majorities). Do not lower REDUCE_VOTES or remove the fill without
    re-running the gate (scripts/ab-mapreduce.ts + ab-report.ts). Every doc_claims
    consumer goes through src/lib/analysis/map-versions.ts (superseded extractor
    versions double-count otherwise).
19. **Publication safety (2026-07-13; strengthened same-day by the remediation):**
    every digest persist passes `guardPublishedEvents`
    (`src/lib/analysis/publication-guard.ts`) BEFORE the overwrite verdict —
    single-doc disputed reputational person-allegations drop AND their event
    title/summary is rebuilt from the retained claims (a dropped allegation's prose
    never survives, even beside a safe confirmed subclaim); disputed named-person
    allegations carry attribution that GOVERNS the allegation (an attribution word
    trailing the assertion — "X died, with reports suggesting…" — does not qualify
    it); allegation-bearing events get deterministic copy for title AND summary
    (model prose never survives there); corroboration promotion never confirms a
    person-allegation on its own; the scoreboard labels non-confirmed unmatched
    claims "BNOW-only reported item" with the hedge shown. Do not bypass the guard
    or weaken these rules without a decision-log entry.

## Decision log (append-only, dated)

Entries through the 2026-07-16 #17 spend-subset deployment are archived **verbatim** in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`; distilled still-binding decisions live in Standing rulings above.

- **2026-07-16 (analyst-experience quick wins implemented — presentation only, NOT deployed)**
  Branch `codex/analyst-experience-quick-wins` from `8bbc308`: Pass 1 `9b4c27e` (labels/nav,
  provider + raw-confidence + First-seen removal, digest freshness, scoreboard results-before-
  methodology, /health row removal) and Pass 2 `846e3f0` (print disclosure, source-first
  evidence, targeted contrast/type). Gate: 1,562 unit tests / 135 files, typecheck, lint,
  `next build` green; 32/32 browser checks in light+dark at 1280 and 390×844. No ingestion,
  analysis, scoring, reliability, traceability, publication-safety, schema, data, paid-provider,
  env, workflow or deploy change; zero paid calls; every route href unchanged. Standing rulings
  1–5 untouched; ruling 15's promotion/href policy re-asserted by test. Decisions worth carrying:
  **(a)** analyst surfaces expose no provider/model string and no raw confidence decimal —
  the score is uncalibrated, so High/Medium/Low waits on #14; **(b)** "First seen by BNOW" is
  presentation-dead but `fetched_at`/`firstSeenAt` is RETAINED as sort tie-break, ranking recency
  fallback and validation-timeliness/health input — a missing `published_at` still renders Unknown
  and never borrows it; **(c)** a digest page claims one stage only when every displayed track
  agrees, otherwise per-track — never "Final" because one track finalized — and promises no
  next-final time; **(d)** the scoreboard caveat must stay OUTSIDE the methodology disclosure.
  Details + measured contrast: `docs/reviews/ANALYST-EXPERIENCE-QUICK-WINS-2026-07-16.md`.
  New debt #71–#74. Awaiting operator approval to deploy.
- **2026-07-16 (dev-server hydration is broken on this WSL2 box — verify against a build)**
  `npm run dev` server-renders correctly but React never hydrates: the `_next/webpack-hmr`
  WebSocket handshake fails (`net::ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE`) and NO React control responds to
  input, including components no one has touched (the mobile hamburger). Native `<details>`
  keeps working, which masks the failure and can make a broken page look interactive. `next
  build` + `next start` hydrates fine and passed all keyboard checks. **Verify React UI against
  a production build here; a dev-server click test proves nothing.** OPEN-TASKS #74.

- **2026-07-16 (legal integration gate restored)** Commit `165c2b4` removed the stale Terms 1.0
  assumption from `legal-acceptance.itest.ts`: current acceptance derives from
  `CURRENT_TERMS_VERSION` / `CURRENT_PRIVACY_VERSION`, the synthetic future pair is explicit and
  order-independent, and the cascade test no longer carries its own policy-version literals. The
  disposable-Neon suite is now **32/32 green across 7 files** (all 5 legal + all 10 enrichment),
  alongside 1,542/134 unit tests, typecheck, and lint; branch `br-restless-pine-at9u1qv1` was
  deleted. Test-only change, no deploy, production mutation, cron invocation, or paid call.
- **2026-07-16 (#17 verification wording correction)** The #17 enrichment integration coverage is
  green (10/10), as are 1,542 unit tests, typecheck, lint, and build; however, the repository-wide
  real-Postgres run was **31 passed / 1 failed**, not fully green. The failure is the pre-existing
  `legal-acceptance.itest.ts` Terms 1.0 expectation left stale by the Terms 1.1 rollout. This does
  not change the reviewed spend-boundary implementation or live-deployment proof, but standing
  quality text now records the red gate accurately until a coding agent fixes that separate test.
- **2026-07-16 (analyst-experience work READY)** #17's active spend boundary is deployed and the
  legal-fixture correction restored the full 32/32 integration gate. The presentation-only analyst
  quick wins may start from clean main ahead of #56/#69/#14; #61/#41 remain separate operator
  gates. Implementation is split into low-layout-risk cleanup followed by evidence/print/readability
  interaction work; monthly scoreboard navigation and feedback-env splitting stay out of scope.
## Conventions

- Commits: `area: imperative summary` (e.g. `isw: parse endnotes from new page layout`).
  Small and often; main must always build.
- Tests: Vitest; every parser/adapter gets fixture-based tests (`fixtures/`). `npm test`
  green before every deploy. Component tests opt into jsdom per-file
  (`@vitest-environment jsdom` docblock).
- Migrations: `npm run db:generate` → `npm run db:migrate` (additivity: ruling 5).
- Naming: snake_case DB, camelCase TS, kebab-case files.
- Scrapers: ≥2s per-host spacing, honor robots.txt, disk-cache every fetch (never fetch
  the same URL twice), custom UA `BNOWBot/0.1 (+https://bnow.net/bot)`.

## Next steps / open questions

1. **Operator:** `docs/SETUP-NEXT-WEEK.md` top-to-bottom — VERCEL_TOKEN regen and Stripe.
   bnow.net attach, Postmark sender cutover + DMARC, and MTProto are done.
   (OpenAI credits: done 2026-07-05; keep the billing alert.)
2. **DIGEST_ENGINE=mapreduce is LIVE in prod (flipped 2026-07-09).** Watch the
   scoreboard for a week — especially ua (−3.6 pts in the A/B, noise-scale) — plus
   `provider_usage.openai_reduce` (expect ≈ $0.10–0.30/day against
   `REDUCE_USD_CAP_DAILY=2`) and `cron_runs` jobs `digest:finalize`/`digest:intraday`.
   Rollback = remove the Vercel prod env var (or set `legacy`) + redeploy. Then: gulf
   theaters onto the map worker, the #33 remap path, per-country mix policy.
3. Debt & risks: `docs/OPEN-TASKS.md` (prioritized); key-blocked items: `docs/BLOCKERS.md`;
   Russia depth build order: `docs/RUSSIA-DATA-ROADMAP.md` §5.

## Operating protocol

1. Plan next ≤2h block as numbered list appended to `docs/PROGRESS.md` (timestamped).
2. Build + test (fixture-based for every parser/adapter).
3. Self-review the diff adversarially: edge cases, rate-limit safety, secret leakage,
   schema invariants (claim-to-source above all).
4. Commit; deploy if main is green.
5. Update AGENTS.md — correct standing sections in place, append to the decision log —
   and `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
6. Replan freely when reality disagrees with the plan. Untouchables: the four scope
   pillars (ingest, registry, digest, ISW validation) and Standing rulings 1–5
   (legal, traceability, truth-in-UI, fail-closed SpendGuard caps, migration
   additivity). Every deviation → decision log.
7. End of each stage/sprint: write `docs/reviews/<NAME>.md` (built, test results,
   exit-criteria pass/fail with numbers, decisions, debt, risks, replan).
