# AGENTS.md — persistent brain of BNOW.NET

Read this first in every fresh session. Keep it under ~300 lines; details live in `docs/`.

**Maintenance rule — ONLY the decision log is append-only.** Every standing section
(Current state, Architecture, directory map, Standing rulings, credentials, conventions,
protocol) MUST be corrected in place the moment it becomes wrong; append a log entry
recording that the correction happened. Never leave wrong standing text with the fix
buried in a log entry. When the log outgrows this file, move its oldest entries
**verbatim** to `docs/DECISIONS.md` (the append-only archive) — moving preserves
history; editing or summarizing it is forbidden.

## Project charter

BNOW.NET is a subscription OSINT data-intelligence product: per-country conflict-monitoring
feeds (open news + Telegram + X), **transparent source-reliability ratings** derived from
ISW's own citation/hedging behavior, an automated daily digest, and a public validation
scoreboard that scores our digests against ISW's daily Russian Offensive Campaign
Assessments. Paying users: analysts, risk teams, journalists, desks ($400–$4K/mo tiers).
Theaters: **Russia + Ukraine + Iran live**; Israel/Gulf ingesting but shallow; bh/kw
scaffolded; China deferred. Authoritative spec: `docs/PRODUCT-BRIEF.md` (installed 2026-07-06).

## Architecture

Stack: Next.js 16 App Router (TS strict) on Vercel · Neon Postgres + pgvector · Drizzle ORM ·
Tailwind v4 · Auth.js (magic link, `session.strategy='database'`) · Vitest (node; jsdom +
@testing-library per-file for component tests). LLM behind `AnalysisProvider`: `openai` live
(gpt-4o-mini), `anthropic` implemented in the seam (no key in any env yet — auto-selected if
an Anthropic key exists and no OpenAI key does), `stub` deterministic fallback.
**No shadcn/ui and no Radix.** UI deps are clsx + tailwind-merge + lucide-react; interactive
primitives (e.g. `src/components/nav-dropdown.tsx`) are hand-rolled to WAI-ARIA patterns.

## Current state — snapshot (verified 2026-07-09; correct in place when it changes)

Live at **https://bnow-net.vercel.app** (Vercel project `bnow-net`, team `vociferous`;
deployment URLs are SSO-walled — always use the project domain). History/narrative:
`docs/PROGRESS.md` + `docs/reviews/`; debt: `docs/OPEN-TASKS.md`.

- **Registry:** 6,985 ISW-derived sources / 251K citations / 1,565 reports (97.65% parse);
  per-theater aggregates in `source_theater_stats` (ru/ir).
- **Ingestion (live):** 29 RSS feeds (ru ua il ir sa ae qa om + bh/kw scaffolded),
  registry-selected + curated Telegram via t.me/s/, X via api.twitterapi.io (383
  ISW-cited accounts), GDELT (wired, upstream-flaky), zakupki procurement (wired,
  blocked — needs proxy).
- **Map stage:** all eligible ru/ua/ir docs since 06-29 mapped once per
  (track, extractor_version) → `doc_claims` (~19K claims), persistent dedup verdicts
  (`doc_dedup`), dispositions (`doc_map_state`); hourly cron keeps it current;
  $0.076/1K docs. Feeds the mapreduce digest engine (below). Shadow evidence:
  `docs/reviews/MAP-SHADOW-RESULTS.md`.
- **Digests — two engines behind `DIGEST_ENGINE`; prod is FLIPPED to `mapreduce`
  (2026-07-09; code default is still legacy when the env is unset, which is the
  rollback):** legacy = the 100-doc batch extraction (source-mix quota, ladder);
  mapreduce = deterministic reduce over doc_claims (star clustering, threshold 0.35,
  corroboration promotion, entity canonicalization) + K=5-voted synthesis over the
  top ~200 ranked claim groups — model cites group ids only, docIds/hedging derive
  server-side. A/B gate PASSED (coverage 25.0 vs 21.1, unsupported 0.30 vs 0.41,
  variance 6.9 vs 8.0; `docs/reviews/MR3-REDUCE-RESULTS.md`). Gulf theaters have no
  doc_claims, so they fall back to legacy automatically. Both engines persist
  through ONE shared path (`digest-persist.ts`) whose overwrite guard refuses empty
  AND thin (<50% prior claims) regenerations (#32 closed; FORCE_REGEN=1 override).
- **Validation vs ISW:** majority-vote LLM matching (k=5, 26/27 reproducible across
  reruns), keyword gazetteer as no-key fallback; ISW report auto-discovery by slug.
  Coverage avg ~17.5% (nonzero-day ~31%), median info-lead +14.7h (2026-07-05 backtest).
- **Surface:** landing / countries / pricing / magic-link auth (Postmark LIVE, still on
  scenefiend sender domain) / digests+registry+entities behind FEATURE_AUTH_GATE /
  signals / trade / datadark / critical-materials / ask (capped 20/user/day, $1/day
  global) / i18n: en+uk full, de ar ja pl fr catalogs (landing wired; needs native
  review before promotion).
- **Tests:** 471 unit tests / 41 files green (`npm test`, ~3s) + Neon-branch
  integration suite (`npm run test:integration`). CI mirror: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`;
  the enforced gate is `.githooks/pre-push` (typecheck+lint+test).
- **Crons (vercel.json):** ingest fast */15 · telegram :10 · x :20 · map :40 (hourly) ·
  digest 02:00 (D+1 finalize) + 04:00/10:00/19:30 (intraday, rolling window,
  delta-framed) · validate 07:00 (scores yesterday = the finalized digest) ·
  enrich 08:00 · datadark 09:00 · trade monthly (2nd) · materials monthly (3rd).
- **Stubbed / off:** MTProto + ACLED (fixture stubs, unwired); Stripe flagged off;
  Resend adapter superseded by Postmark.
- **Deploy:** `npx vercel@latest deploy --prod --yes` — machine CLI session
  (`VERCEL_TOKEN` is expired; regen is an operator task, SETUP-NEXT-WEEK #2).
- **This WSL2 box:** the NAT resolver times out on some domains — a DNS quirk, NOT a
  TCP block. `NODE_OPTIONS="--require ./scripts/pin-dns.cjs"` pins vercel/openai/
  understandingwar DNS to public resolvers, making local single-call LLM debugging
  work; bulk LLM work still runs via deployed Vercel routes (prod env + metering).
  github.com resolves slowly/flakily: pushes work, but short-timeout git commands can
  fail — retry or wait ~30s+. api.gdeltproject.org DNS still fails locally (not
  pinned). TASS/RIA/Lenta RSS unreachable → covered via their Telegram channels.
- **Git:** origin/main == local main as of 2026-07-09; there is no push blocker.

## Standing rulings (distilled from the decision log; binding until a log entry supersedes)

Invariants — absolute, each owned here:

1. **Legal:** no ISW prose or source full-text in any user-facing output — only URLs,
   classifications, counts, scores. ISW takeaway text may enter an LLM prompt
   transiently; only verdicts persist.
2. **Traceability:** every claim keeps ≥1 raw_document link (FK + app-layer transaction
   + DB trigger `drizzle/9999_claim_source_trigger.sql`; `migrations.test.ts` guards it).
3. **Truth-in-UI:** stub/fixture data never persists or renders as fact — excluded at
   query level and HIDDEN entirely, never demo-labelled.
4. **Spend:** every paid-provider call passes `SpendGuard.tryReserve()` first and FAILS
   CLOSED when its total-cap env is unset. Caps: `LLM_SPRINT_USD_CAP` (all-time
   backstop), `LLM_DIGEST_USD_CAP` (daily), `MAP_USD_CAP_DAILY`, `X_SPRINT_USD_CAP` +
   `X_DAILY_USD_CAP`, `OPENSANCTIONS_CALL_CAP`. Set a new cap env in ALL Vercel envs
   BEFORE deploying the guard that reads it, or you stop that pipeline.
5. **Migrations:** never edit or delete an applied migration; evolve forward with a new
   one. `9999_claim_source_trigger.sql` re-asserts without DROP, always applies last —
   never renumber it or let drizzle-kit regeneration drop it.

Operational rulings:

6. LLM proposals are never auto-applied — entity audit is propose-only with human review.
7. Batched per-item LLM extraction MUST pin `minItems`/`maxItems` = batch size in the
   strict response schema: gpt-4o-mini silently under-fills otherwise (43–57% omission
   measured; prompt wording does not fix it, constrained decoding does).
8. LLM metering lives inside the provider's `analyze()`, never at call sites; truncated
   responses are recorded before being discarded (OpenAI bills them in full).
9. `LLM_DISABLE=1` semantics differ by call site ON PURPOSE: digest / anthropic /
   entity-audit throw typed `LlmDisabledError`; llm-match degrades to keyword matcher;
   /ask degrades to its deterministic cited-claims path (a throw there would cost a
   validation run or 500 a user page).
10. `cron_runs` rows are written at START; `finished_at IS NULL` is the timeout signal.
11. Language routing: fa→ir and uk→ua, plus per-channel theater pins. Arabic is NEVER
    routed by language — it spans six theaters; per-channel pins carry it. Theater is
    a coverage lens, not nationality: the three Lebanese channels are pinned to ir
    (2026-07-09 adjudication of #29); multi-theater source tagging is the eventual
    fix (OPEN-TASKS #37).
12. Dedup verdicts are same-theater and ±1 day only — cross-theater collapse drops
    claims; identical content on distant days is a recurring template, not a mirror.
13. Map extraction is versioned: `extractor_version` = model + prompt hash; consumers
    filter to `mapExtractorVersion()` current versions or they double-count.
    `raw_documents.processed` means exactly "map reached a final disposition"; version
    bumps need their own remap path (OPEN-TASKS #33).
14. Digest corpora are strictly per-theater (`rd.country_iso2`), reliability-ordered,
    with the ~40% source-mix cap on gather window and LLM batch.
15. Nav promotes only ru/ua/ir (promoting 2-digest theaters overstates depth); coverage
    links go to `/countries#<iso2>` (theater pages don't exist; digests are gated);
    locale links carry no `?to=` (Referer round-trips path+query, `?to=` drops query).
16. Unhedged ISW declaratives stay `hedging='unknown'` (mid-trust 0.5) — forcing the 4
    classes would corrupt the reliability signal.
17. Don't trust a lone digest regeneration: extraction yield varies wildly between
    identical runs (10→1 claims observed). The shared persist guard now refuses
    empty and thin (<50% of prior claims) overwrites on BOTH engines
    (`digest-persist.ts`; FORCE_REGEN=1 override; refusals land in cron_runs).
18. The mapreduce engine ships only its A/B-validated configuration: K=5 synthesis
    votes + majority-gid fill (K=3 FAILED the variance gate — marginal events flip
    out of 2-of-3 majorities). Do not lower REDUCE_VOTES or remove the fill without
    re-running the gate (scripts/ab-mapreduce.ts + ab-report.ts). Every doc_claims
    consumer goes through src/lib/analysis/map-versions.ts (superseded extractor
    versions double-count otherwise).

## Decision log (append-only, dated)

Entries 2026-07-04 → 2026-07-09 (MR sprints 1–2, tooling, restructure) are archived
VERBATIM in `docs/DECISIONS.md`; this log keeps the current cycle (MR sprint 3 + the
cutover). Distilled still-binding decisions live in Standing rulings above.

- **2026-07-09 (MR sprint 3, TASK 0)** OPEN-TASKS #29 adjudicated by the operator: the three
  Lebanese Arabic channels (mtvlebanonews, sameralhajali, mmirleb) route to **ir**. Rationale:
  theater is a coverage lens, not nationality — Hezbollah/Lebanon proxy-network content sits
  inside the IRAN_MILITARY_PROMPT's explicit scope and the ISW Iran Update validation baseline.
  Executed: three `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_THEATER` pins, map holdout (`MAP_HOLDOUT_SOURCE_KEYS`)
  removed, `retag-theater --apply` moved 651 docs ru→ir, deployed, one catch-up map run drained
  the backlog (620 selected → 100% disposition, 41 claims, $0.0041, 0 integrity violations).
  This also removes the legacy-vs-mapreduce A/B asymmetry before the sprint-3 gate runs.
  Standing ruling 11 corrected in place; follow-up = multi-theater source tagging at Tier-2/3
  expansion (new OPEN-TASKS #37).
- **2026-07-09 (MR sprint 3)** Reduce + synthesis shipped; **A/B gate evaluated honestly across
  two rounds and passed; cutover deployed with the flag default LEGACY.** Round 1 (K=3 votes)
  FAILED the variance criterion (within-cell coverage SD 10.5 vs legacy 8.0, paired p=0.35):
  marginal events flip out of 2-of-3 vote majorities between generations, dropping exactly the
  frontline claims ISW scores (ru 07-07: 100→33→0). Fixes: K=5 (majority 3-of-5) + majority-gid
  fill (majority-supported groups dropped by the median roll get deterministic claims from group
  text). Round 2 passed all three criteria: coverage 25.0 vs 21.1 (ir +15.1 p=0.067, ru parity,
  ua −3.6 p=0.45 noise-scale — WATCH post-flip), SD 6.9 vs 8.0, unsupported 0.30 vs 0.41; #28
  reproducibility 0.75 vs 0.55; distinct docs cited 24.9 vs 9.5. New rulings 17 (corrected) + 18.
  Cadence: 02:00 D+1 finalize + 04:00/10:00/19:30 intraday (rolling 24h, delta-framed) replaces
  the 4×6h yesterday+today loop — the 8–10.2× re-extraction redundancy (audit §11) is retired on
  both engines (legacy now regenerates ≤4×/digest-day). REDUCE_USD_CAP_DAILY=2 set in all three
  Vercel envs BEFORE the deploy. A/B evidence: MR3-AB-RESULTS.jsonl + MR3-AB-K5.jsonl + report
  in MR3-REDUCE-RESULTS.md; sprint LLM spend ≈ $1.76 of $12. The A/B driver's one incident —
  the reduce guard's 500-req/day cap fail-closing round 2 mid-sweep — cost zero samples
  (resumable-by-key design); cap raised via env for the run, prod default unchanged.
  Closes OPEN-TASKS #18, #28, #32, #34, #35. Flip = operator sets DIGEST_ENGINE=mapreduce
  in Vercel prod env + redeploy; rollback = unset + redeploy.
- **2026-07-09 (cutover EXECUTED)** `DIGEST_ENGINE=mapreduce` added to the Vercel
  **production** env and redeployed (`dpl_4HdAJA7ZjAKiUGMLamf1ndDnWgpM`, READY, project
  domain serving 200). ru/ua/ir digests now generate through the reduce+synthesis engine;
  gulf theaters keep falling back to legacy (no doc_claims). Standing sections corrected in
  place. Verified by evidence, not assumption — one narrow live run
  (`?mode=intraday&country=ir&track=nuclear`, 172 docs) returned
  `provider: "openai:gpt-4o-mini+mapreduce"`, wrote a fresh `provider_usage.openai_reduce`
  row (5 requests = the K=5 synthesis votes of ruling 18, $0.0054), left `openai_digest`
  un-incremented, and closed its `cron_runs` row `ok=true` in 40s.
  **Two operational notes for the next flip.** (1) Vercel CLI 55 stores a CLI-added var as
  type **Sensitive**, which is write-only: `vercel env ls` shows only its name and
  `vercel env run -e production -- printenv DIGEST_ENGINE` prints nothing. You cannot read
  the value back to confirm it — the only proof the runtime sees the right string is an
  actual digest run. Add the value with `printf 'mapreduce' | vercel env add …` (no trailing
  newline): `digestEngine()` compares `=== "mapreduce"`, so a stray `\n` from `echo` would
  silently serve legacy forever while every dashboard reads "set". (2) `.env.local` was
  deliberately NOT mirrored: it lacks `REDUCE_USD_CAP_DAILY`, so a local mapreduce run would
  fail closed at the reduce guard (ruling 4). Mirror both envs together or neither.
- **2026-07-09 (env mirror; corrects the entry above)** `.env.local` now mirrors both prod vars,
  `DIGEST_ENGINE=mapreduce` + `REDUCE_USD_CAP_DAILY=2` (verified through the loader:
  `digestEngine()` → mapreduce, `reduceDailyUsdCap()` → 2). Value sourced from the entry above,
  not read back — both are stored Sensitive — and corroborated by `REDUCE_DAILY_USD_CAP_DEFAULT
  = 2`. **Note (2) above named the wrong guard; corrected here, since the log is append-only.**
  Per-day caps resolve `envCap(…) ?? (isProduction() ? null : 2)` (digest/map/reduce alike), so
  they fail closed ONLY in production; the environment-independent fail-closed is the TOTAL cap
  (`spend-guard.ts` refuses when `totalCapUsd` and `totalRequestCap` are both unset) — which is
  precisely what ruling 4 says. Ruling right, entry's mechanism wrong. So `LLM_SPRINT_USD_CAP`
  stays absent from `.env.local`: local digest/map/reduce runs refuse to spend at `tryReserve()`,
  which is what stops a stray local script billing the account. Set it only to pay for a run.

## Conventions

- Commits: `area: imperative summary` (e.g. `isw: parse endnotes from new page layout`).
  Small and often; main must always build.
- Tests: Vitest; every parser/adapter gets fixture-based tests (`fixtures/`). `npm test`
  green before every deploy. Component tests opt into jsdom per-file
  (`@vitest-environment jsdom` docblock).
- Migrations: `npm run db:generate` → `npm run db:migrate` (additivity: ruling 5).
- Naming: snake_case DB, camelCase TS, kebab-case files.
- Scrapers: ≥2s per-host spacing, honor robots.txt, disk-cache every fetch (never fetch
  the same URL twice), custom UA `BNOWBot/0.1 (+https://bnow.net/bot)`.

## Next steps / open questions

1. **Operator:** `docs/SETUP-NEXT-WEEK.md` top-to-bottom — VERCEL_TOKEN regen, bnow.net
   DNS + domain attach, Postmark sender-domain move off scenefiend, MTProto, Stripe.
   (OpenAI credits: done 2026-07-05; keep the billing alert.)
2. **DIGEST_ENGINE=mapreduce is LIVE in prod (flipped 2026-07-09).** Watch the
   scoreboard for a week — especially ua (−3.6 pts in the A/B, noise-scale) — plus
   `provider_usage.openai_reduce` (expect ≈ $0.10–0.30/day against
   `REDUCE_USD_CAP_DAILY=2`) and `cron_runs` jobs `digest:finalize`/`digest:intraday`.
   Rollback = remove the Vercel prod env var (or set `legacy`) + redeploy. Then: gulf
   theaters onto the map worker, the #33 remap path, per-country mix policy.
3. Debt & risks: `docs/OPEN-TASKS.md` (prioritized); key-blocked items: `docs/BLOCKERS.md`;
   Russia depth build order: `docs/RUSSIA-DATA-ROADMAP.md` §5.

## Operating protocol

1. Plan next ≤2h block as numbered list appended to `docs/PROGRESS.md` (timestamped).
2. Build + test (fixture-based for every parser/adapter).
3. Self-review the diff adversarially: edge cases, rate-limit safety, secret leakage,
   schema invariants (claim-to-source above all).
4. Commit; deploy if main is green.
5. Update AGENTS.md — correct standing sections in place, append to the decision log —
   and `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
6. Replan freely when reality disagrees with the plan. Untouchables: the four scope
   pillars (ingest, registry, digest, ISW validation) and Standing rulings 1–5
   (legal, traceability, truth-in-UI, fail-closed SpendGuard caps, migration
   additivity). Every deviation → decision log.
7. End of each stage/sprint: write `docs/reviews/<NAME>.md` (built, test results,
   exit-criteria pass/fail with numbers, decisions, debt, risks, replan).
